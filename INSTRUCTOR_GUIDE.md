- [ ] Chrome or Firefox browser

### 2. Test the Viewer

1. Open the viewer URL
2. Navigate through all 10 questions
3. Test voting on a few responses
4. Check statistics display
5. Verify auto-refresh works

### 3. Prepare Discussion Points

Review common issues in SR appraisals:
- Question 1: PECO framework understanding
- Question 3: Search comprehensiveness
- Question 4: Quality assessment methods
- Question 5: Heterogeneity and meta-analysis
- Question 10: Risk-benefit analysis

## Classroom Facilitation Guide

### Opening (5 minutes)

1. **Project the viewer** on main screen
2. **Explain the interface**:
   - "We'll review your SR appraisals together"
   - "All responses are anonymized"
   - "Vote for explanations you find particularly insightful"
   - "We'll discuss patterns and exemplars"

3. **Set expectations**:
   - Respectful critique
   - Focus on reasoning, not right/wrong
   - Learning from peer approaches

### Question-by-Question Review (4-5 minutes each)

#### For Each Question:

1. **Read the question aloud**
2. **Show CONSIDER prompts** (click toggle)
3. **Review statistics first**:
   - "Let's see the answer distribution"
   - Discuss if skewed heavily one way
4. **Filter responses** if needed:
   - Start with "Can't Tell" to address uncertainty
   - Then "No" responses for critique
   - Finally "Yes" for confirmation
5. **Highlight top-voted responses**:
   - "Student 7 received the most votes, let's see why"
   - Read explanation aloud
   - Discuss reasoning quality

### Using Statistics (Throughout)

Click "📊 Show Statistics" to reveal:

#### Answer Distribution
- **Consensus** (>80% same answer): "Strong agreement on this question"
- **Split** (roughly even): "Interesting divergence - let's explore why"
- **High uncertainty** (many Can't Tell): "What information was missing?"

#### Top Voted Responses
- "These explanations resonated with your peers"
- Use as exemplars
- Discuss what makes them effective

#### Uncertainty Analysis
- Identify questions with most "Can't Tell"
- Address knowledge gaps
- Clarify CASP criteria

## Interactive Activities

### Activity 1: Peer Voting (10 minutes)

1. **Instructions to students**:
   - "Take 5 minutes to read through Question 3 responses"
   - "Vote for the explanation that best justifies the answer"
   - "You can vote once per response"

2. **Live monitoring**:
   - Watch votes accumulate in real-time
   - Auto-refresh shows changes

3. **Discussion**:
   - "Let's look at the top 3 voted responses"
   - "What makes these explanations strong?"

### Activity 2: Filter Challenge (5 minutes)

1. **Set a filter** (e.g., "No" responses only)
2. **Challenge**: "Find the response that best explains why studies weren't comprehensive"
3. **Discuss** common themes in filtered responses

### Activity 3: Can't Tell Analysis (10 minutes)

1. **Show uncertainty chart** in statistics
2. **Focus on highest** "Can't Tell" question
3. **Discussion prompts**:
   - "What information would you need?"
   - "Is this the paper's fault or limitation of reporting?"
   - "How would you find this information?"

## Managing Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Clear Consensus

**Approach**:

- Explore different interpretations
- Emphasize critical thinking over consensus

### Scenario 2: All "Can't Tell"

**Approach**:
- Validates difficulty of appraisal
- Discuss reporting quality issues
- Show how to find missing information

### Scenario 3: Excellent Response

**Approach**:
- Highlight without identifying student
- Break down what makes it excellent
- Use as template for future work

### Scenario 4: Common Misconception

**Approach**:
- Address generally, not specifically
- "I notice several responses mention..."
- Clarify the concept thoroughly
